Jus tchecking the remove course MATH 20C results and I noticed that in BE25 there's a 50-something point complexity drop but in BENG 27 there's only 29.3 points. That's interesting because BE27 shouldn't show up at all... (MATH 20C shows up as MATH 20C/31BH and the function uses canonical name...) This merits double checking, but by me. Nobody would be able to tell to contest the veracity of the program unless I told them. 

Looking at the results of adding math 20c as a prereq to chem 6c i noticed that in an29 the erc (and a few others) there's no difference. However, there is a change in the curriculum. That's weird. I checked the curriculum and there is a CHEM 6C but in the ERC plan there is no CHEM 6C. This is very weird. My guess is this is a relic of using the Marshall plan as the template for curricula.

In this same query i noticed a few courses looking at the dataframes for MATH 4C and 3C. They should stop at MATH 20A.

In removing CSE 21 from being a prereq for CSE 100, TH was unaffected in CS25. This is because it has two CSE 21s, CSE 21 1 and CSE 21 2. neither exactly matches CSE 21, so they weren't removed. Why does this only happen in the marshall one?
