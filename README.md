This is just me messing around with Julia HTTP and Websocket syntax. The proper project will be done on a separate repo. 

- [ ] Use the multipart syntax for the simple what if
- [ ] Just parse the strings for the institutional what if
- [ ] AND later, if you have time, add a version where you can upload that FAT FAT file to do institutional questions for some other institution. 


This branch is an attempt to rework the server to be more like an api. That is due to the fact that for the life of me I don't understand how they do different port listening, so I'll just cram everthing into one port but with different urls.
